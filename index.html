				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<img src="assets/images/profile-picture.jpg" alt="">
				<p>So here's the deal, I'm into photography, philosophy, weight lifting and jogging. I've been reading some books about self improvement which I've been focusing on for the past couple of years. Two years ago one of my friends up and left everything behind and started pursuing a dream of her's. This was crazy inspirational to me and made me realize the only thing stopping me to doing the things I really wanted was myself. I bought a plane ticket to New Zealand and did a two week road trip with my friend Justin. Since then I've been all over Arizona. Some other notable places have been Joshua Tree, the Enchanted Tower in New Mexico, and day trips to California. In Arizona, I've hiked the Grand Canyon, hiked to Havasupi twice, Sedona, Grand Falls, Flatiron, Weaver's Needle, Antelope Canyon and Horseshoe Bend.</p>
				<p>During this time I've come to realize a lot about myself. I typically tend to be introspective, so these trips give me plenty of time to think. One of the most important things I've come to understand is that when we try to impress others, that very act in itself is needy and repelling. People like our ridge and edges. People like when we have our own opinions, and find it incredibly refreshing we stick up and fight for what we believe in - about anything. The moment we give that up, is the moment we become boring. I', super greatful to have had the opportunity to do the things I've done and come to understand what I do now. I only wish I would have seen this a long time ago.</p>
